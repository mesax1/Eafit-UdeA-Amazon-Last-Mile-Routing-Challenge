# Eafit-UdeA-Amazon-Last-Mile-Routing-Challenge
 This code is the contribution of the team "EAFIT-UDEA" (Juan Pablo Mesa, Alejandro Montoya, and Raul Ramos), 9th place in "Last Mile Routing Research Challenge" organized by MIT and Amazon.
 
The data for execution is missing. In order to use data from the challenge:
1) clone this repository
2) add the /data directory from the challenge at the same level of the /src directory.
4) install gcc compiler and boost 1.72.0 library
5) install Python 3.8 with the libraries and packages in requirements.txt 
6) execute model_build.sh
7) execute model_apply.sh

We also added a Dockerfile in case you want to use the docker image we used in the challenge (which allows you to skip steps 2-5)
